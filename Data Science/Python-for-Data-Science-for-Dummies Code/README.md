# Python-for-Data-Science-for-Dummies-2
I have started my own version of a Python Jupyter Notebook to follow along to exercises relating to this book entitled: "Python for Data Science for Dummies - 2nd Edition" by John Paul Mueller & Luca Massaron, John Wiley & Sons (2019), ISBN:978-1-119-54762-4; ISBN:978-1-119-54766-2(ebk).

Hi, I've been learning Python Jupyter Notebooks and I love the look of it as well as it's ability to incorporate other code snippets and visualization. I am completely self taught but I get huge satisfaction out of problem solving even when I'm stuck on providing a solution, it helps if I re-trace my steps and try to figure out where I've gone wrong.  When I'm learning I like to listen to thefuture.fm, radioactivefm.co.uk or heartthis.at to help relax and motivate me too.

The code exercises contained within this book provide valuable material when it comes to transforming and shaping datasets before using them in a Data Science scenario. Once the necessary data munging has taken place, then it becomes possible to apply any appropriate statistical analysis and try and figure out which algorithms will eventually imporove the efficiency of your hardware and software given your objectives.
